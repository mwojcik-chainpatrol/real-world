> ### NextJS + tRPC + Prisma codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc.) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **NextJS + tRPC + Prisma** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **NextJS + tRPC + Prisma** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

This project uses NextJS and its pages router to serve a React frontend. The backend utilizes tRPC, which usually does not expose a usable REST API, which is required by the RealWorld specs, therefor [trpc-openai](https://github.com/prosepilot/trpc-openapi) is used to create a REST API and also generate a Swagger UI.

The database is managed by Prisma; for simplicityâ€™s sake it uses a sqlite database, but it can be easily changed to any other database supported by Prisma.

Testing is done using Playwright for the Frontend und currently only the official RealWorld API Postman tests for the backend.

# Project Structure

- `prisma` - The Prisma schema and sqlite database
- `public` - Static assets
- `src` - The NextJS application
  - `components` - React components used in the pages
  - `pages` - NextJS pages & api route setup
  - `server` - Setup for the database and tRPC router
  - `styles` - Official RealWorld css styles
- `tests` - Tests (includes the official RealWorld api postman tests)

# Getting started

Copy the example env to a real env file. To run the application you do not have to change anything, only if you want to use a different database or use a secure JWT secret.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Install all the dependencies, this will also set up the prisma sqlite database.

```bash
pnpm install
```

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

To run the UI tests:

```bash
pnpm test:ui
```

To run the API tests:

```bash
pnpm test:api
```
